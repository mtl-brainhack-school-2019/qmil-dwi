Quantitative Microstructure Imaging Laboratory - Diffusion Weighted MRI
=============

Vladimir Grouza

Supervisor: Dr. David Rudko

Rotation project: use diffusion MR parameter metrics to quantify demyelination in mice on a persistent diet of cuprizone (CPZ). For the purpose of the Brainhack school, I aim to make use of open source tools to implement a small pipeline to import and manipulate image data in a python environment and attempt to familarize myself with the diffusion map fitting process. 

## Data Set ##

Each complete acquisition yeilds a b_0 image, a set of images at at leasat two feild strengths, and a gradient table. These are required to fit a diffusion tensor.
